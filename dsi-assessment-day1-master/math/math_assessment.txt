Math Assessment

Refer to `math_assessment.pdf` for the questions. Please type your answers under
each prompt in this document.


1. Partial derivative of y with respect to x
-sin(z)e^-x

2. Xy
[2,12]
[3, 9]
3. Is X invertible? If so, give the inverse; if not, explain why not.

I don't know I don't remember the rules if so..

[2,1]
[4,3]

4. Rank of X
2

5. Sample mean

.6

6. Sample variance

.24 

7. Probability of data given fair coin

37% used binomial distribution formula in order to get a probability
8. Maximum likelihood probability
_
x = μ
:.  μ=.6

wasn't sure what was asking thinking how could we increase the probability of getting those results with the coin
9. P(x=T | y=b)

.25
used bays theorem
